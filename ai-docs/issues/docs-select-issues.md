## Overview

Highlighting or selecting one issue both allow you to take actions on the issue using keyboard shortcuts, the command menu, or right-click to bring up the contextual menu. The two differentiates when it comes to multiple issues.

By default, no issue is selected when you open a board or list of issues.

## Highlight an issue

* Hover over the issue with your cursor until the issue is highlighted
* Use `↑` / `↓` or `J` / `K` to navigate the page to the issue.

## Select issues

* Once an issue is highlighted, press `X` shortcut.
* Hold `Shift` and _click_ your mouse on the issue.
* Bring up a checkbox element by moving your cursor over the far left of any issue (near where the issue meets the sidebar).

### Select multiple issues

Once an issue is selected, use the navigation to highlight another issue and press `X`.

To select multiple _consecutive_ issues:

* Hold down Shift after selecting the first issue, then use the `↑` / `↓` keys to increase the selected range one issue at a time.
* Use filters to refine the issue list first, then use Cmd/Ctrl A to select all issues on a board or list.

### Clear selection

Press `Esc` will clear selected issues on your list or board.

## Take actions

Once an issue or set of issues are selected, use `Cmd/Ctrl` `K` to open the command bar and select the preferred action or right-click anywhere on the selected issue(s) to open the contextual menu for a list of available actions.

### Moving issues to top, bottom, or in increments

To move an issue or issues up or down the list:

1. In the _Display Options_, set the Grouping to **No grouping**.
2. Set the _Ordering_ to **Manual**.
3. Select the issue(s) you want to move.
4. Use the shortcut `Option/Alt` `Shift` `↑` or `Option/Alt` `Shift` `↓` to move an issue/issues in increments.

### Update multiple issues

Select them with shortcuts or the mouse and then update the issue field like you would any issue. Common bulk actions will show up at the bottom.

* **Select all keyboard shortcut:** To change issue priority so all issues without a priority were assigned no priority, filter to `no priority` issues and then used `Cmd/Ctrl` `A` then `P` to update the priority.
* **Use mouse to select multiple issues:** To move some issues from Todo to backlog, select by hovering over them and individually marking the checkbox that popped up.
* **Use keyboard to select multiple issues and bulk action toolbar:** Holding down `Shift` while moving the `up/down` buttons to select multiple issues and choose a bulk action such as  `Move to backlog`.
