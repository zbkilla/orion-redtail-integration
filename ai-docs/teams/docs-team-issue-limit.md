# Team Issue limits

## Overview

If you have received a warning about the amount of issues in one of the teams on your workspace, you may have exceeded or neared the issue quota permitted per team.   
  
In order to deliver the best performance and speed that Linear is known for, individual teams on workspaces are limited to **25,000 issues.**  
  
Issues created through integrations or the API will be prevented from creating more issues on the affected team if it exceeds this limit.  


### Recommended next steps

To reduce the amount of issues per team on your workspaces, we recommend the following:   


* [Delete](https://linear.app/docs/delete-issues) older issues no longer needed 
* [Move issues](https://linear.app/docs/move-to-new-team) into other teams so they are distributed
* [Configure](https://linear.app/docs/archive-issues) your issues to be auto-archived earlier

### FAQ

<details>
<summary>Can I manually archive issues?</summary>
You can only manually delete issues. Issues are archived depending on the [archiving automations ](https://linear.app/docs/archive-issues)set in team workflow settings. You can also move issues to other teams to keep under the limit.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is there an issue limit?</summary>
Teams that have greater than 25,000 issues may be subjected to degraded performance. We believe that 25,000 active issues per team is a generous allowance and will enable your workspace to have optimal performance and speed.   
Archived issues are not counted towards this limit.
