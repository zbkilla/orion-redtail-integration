## Basics

### Create templates

Create new templates by navigating to either the workspace template settings or team template settings.   
  
When creating a project template, you have the option to add the following:

* Project name 
* Project description
* Team(s) the project lives in
* Project status
* Project lead
* Project members
* Associated initiatives
* Project milestones
* Issues to be created within the project 

When you create a template for the workspace, all teams can use it. When you create a template for a team, only that team can use the template.



### Edit templates

To edit or delete a template, go to the same page where you created the templates and then hover over the template name in order to show contextual controls. From there, you can edit the the template, rename it, duplicate it or delete it.

### Use templates

When creating a new project, you will see the option to select a template beside the team identifier in the top left of the project create modal. You can also open our command menu using `CMD` `K `and search for the option to create a project using a template here.
