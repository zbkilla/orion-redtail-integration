## Overview

The project overview provides a comprehensive summary of the project. It allows you to include both a brief summary and an extensive description. You can also link to external resources for easy team access, and create [documents](https://linear.app/docs/project-documents) inside of Linear to track project specs, updates, and notes. Milestones can be created and viewed from here, and milestone progress can also be tracked. This ensures that project planning can begin directly in Linear from the first moment a project is conceived.

Add a link label to give the link a title, otherwise we'll show the link source (e.g. docs.google.com). To edit an existing link label, hover over the relevant link, click on the **`â‹® `** icon and choose the edit option here.

### Project documents

To add an external link to a Linear project, go to the `Resources` section. Press the  `+` button and select Create Document. Documents use the same Markdown as issues and have similar editing capabilities including tagging others and linking to issues.



### Detailed description

The detailed description of a project functions similarly to a document and you can edit text, tag team members and link to issues, projects and documents from here. You can also post [inline comments](https://linear.app/docs/project-documents#inline-comments). 



### Milestones

You can view a list of [project milestones](https://linear.app/docs/project-milestones) in the project overview. You can reorder the milestones from here, set their target dates and edit their names. You can also include a detailed description below each milestone.



## Project details sidebar

As well as viewing project properties, documents and link attachments attachments in the project overview, you can also view them in the project details sidebar with `Cmd/Ctrl` `I ` or by clicking on the sidebar button in the top right. You can change all properties from here as well as from the project overview. The project details sidebar is accessible from the project overview and also from the project issues page.



### Project graph

We'll generate a [graph](https://linear.app/docs/project-graph) for your project that shows scope, velocity, progress over time, and generates live predictions for when the project will complete. This is viewable from the project details sidebar.
