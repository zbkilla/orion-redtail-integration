## Overview

Priority is an optional property for Linear projects to signify to your team the urgency of the project. You can add the following priorities to projects: no priority, low, medium, high, and urgent.

## Set priority

Select a project (or multiple) from the projects view, type `P ,_then_, P` to select the project priority. Use the shortcut again to change or remove the priority.  
You can also right-click on a project to set priority from the menu.

## Priority ordering

By default, items without an assigned priority level are now always sorted last.

If projects are ordered by priority, you can manually or micro-adjust a projects position within the same priority group, if needed. So if you have multiple high priority projects for example, you can click and drag to reorder a project to be higher in its group.   
  
Dragging a project into a priority group will apply that same priority to the project.
