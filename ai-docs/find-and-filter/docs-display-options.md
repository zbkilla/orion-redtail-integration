# Display Options

Display options let you group and order issues and projects to determine which information appears in your view.

## Overview

Display options appear on every view in Linear. On issue views, they allow you to order and group issues in various ways, switch between board and list layouts, and choose which information is displayed. On project and initiative views, they control the layout between timeline and list views as well the grouping and ordering of information. Display options can be saved as personal preferences or as the default display options on that page for your workspace.

### Keyboard

`Shift` `V` to open display options 

`Cmd/Ctrl` `B` to toggle between list and board on issue views

### Mouse

* Select the _Display options_ button that shows up on the top right corner of a view. If the view does not have Display options, it is not supported for that view.
* To update for your view only, simply modify the display options (do _not_ Set as default). 
* Press Set as default to save the current display options as the default for other members in your workspace. It will be the view they see when they first open it, but they can always apply their own preferences on top of it.
* Press _Reset to default_ to revert back to the default (Saved) display options.

## Basics

### Saving display options

To update your view only, customize the view and then navigate away from the options menu by clicking anywhere in the app. Your selections will persist even if you navigate away from the current view. 

To update the display options on that page for your whole workspace, press _Set as default_ after customizing the view. This will apply the configuration to every other user in your workspace. 

If you customize a view's display options and wish to return to the default configuration, Click _Reset to default._

### Available display options

Every view in Linear is slightly different and will display different display options. _Triage_ and _Inbox_ only let you update the ordering and not grouping properties. We'll work to expand display options over time.

### Issue view

#### Layout

If a board is available for your view, you'll see the option and can toggle between lists and boards.  `Cmd/Ctrl` `B` will also toggle the layout.

#### Grouping

Grouping is allowed in most list views and lets you group issues by Status, Assignee, Project, Priority, Cycle or Focus*. No grouping removes all categorization and is especially useful when applying ordering and filters. Grouping settings will affect whether you can order issues manually.  
  
Beside each group in board or list view, you will see either the total number of issues in the group or the total estimate of all issues in the group. You can click this to toggle between either option.  


*Focus is available in the _My Issue_s view. Focus is a unique grouping that attempts to organize issues assigned to you in order of what you'd want to work on first.

#### Sub-grouping

Sub-grouping is available in lists and boards (as rows).   
In board view having rows helps for a swim-lane style structure common in project management.

The grouping header will remain sticky as you scroll down so it's clear what grouping and sub-grouping you have in these views.  
  
You can drag and drop issues between each grouping and it will automatically adopt the properties of that grouping.

#### Ordering

Ordering is allowed in most list views and lets you order issues within their groupings by a number of properties, including Status, Manual, Priority, Last created, Last updated, Due date, and Link count.   
  
You can also reverse the sort order of your issues, except when sorting manually or by status. 

#### Manual ordering

Manual ordering is default for board views and can be selected in most list views. To move issues around, select them with your mouse and drag them to a new position. Manual ordering is unique in that it will update the manual order for everyone in the workspace. 

#### Sub-issues

Toggle this setting on to show sub-issues in the list or off to only show parent issues and issues without sub-issues.

#### Show empty groups

When toggled, this setting will hide groupings without any issues.

#### Display properties

Choose what issue properties are displayed on individual issues on lists or the board. This is different from filters; filters will refine the list to only issues with certain properties while display options show all issues in the list but hide or show data on the issue item or board card.

Display properties include _Issue ID_, _Priority_, _Status, Labels, Project, Cycle, Created, Updated, Assignee, Estimate, Links, Sentry issues,_ and _Pull Request_s _and Commits._ On Enterprise plans, _SLA_ is also a supported Display property.

## Initiatives and project views

#### Layout

Switch between list view and timeline view.

#### Ordering

Order projects manually, or by properties like status, priority or updated or created time. You can group by lead, member, status, health, start date, and target date in initiatives or in project views. You can also group by initiatives in project views.

You can reverse the sort order of your projects, except when sorting manually or by status. 

#### Zoom

Zoom the timeline view to focus on a month, quarter, or year. Use the mouse (two finger swipe on Mac) to scroll backwards and forwards in time.

#### Completed projects

Under the active view tab, show projects that have completed in the last week, month, or year -- even if they've been closed. You can also select to show all projects no matter the status, or no completed projects in the active view.
