### Applicable views

If a view can be favorited, you'll see the outline of a star in the top bar next to the view name. You can favorite the following views in Linear: 

* Issues
* Users
* [Projects](https://linear.app/docs/projects)
* [Specific Cycles](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles)
* [Custom Views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views)
* [Label views](https://linear.app/docs/label-views) 
* [Default views](https://linear.app/docs/default-views): all issues, active issues, backlog, board, current cycles, upcoming cycles.

> [!NOTE]
> Some views cannot be favorited, like the view of another user's issues that you see after clicking their name. Instead, you can create a custom view with filters to see the same issues, and add this to your favorites instead.

### Add favorites

To favorite, select the ⭐ icon in the page header. You can also select the issue and search for the `favorite` command. Favorites do not always show up on contextual menus.

### Create folders

To create a folder for favorites, hover over favorites and click the icon to the right to create a new folder, or create from the ⭐ icon menu. You can give it a name of your choosing and easily drag any existing favorites in or out of the folder.

### Access favorites

Once you favorite an issue, you'll see a _Favorites_ section appear in your sidebar above _Your Teams_. You can access favorites by clicking on them from the sidebar or searching for them in the command menu. The shortcut `O` then `F` will open a menu from which you can open a favorite, too.

### Remove favorite

Hover over the favorite in the sidebar and click on the `X` to remove it. This is not reversible but you can easily add the favorite again by going to the issue or view and selecting the star.
