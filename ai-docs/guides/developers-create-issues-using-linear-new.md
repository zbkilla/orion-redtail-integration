# Create issues using linear.new

You can open Linear using a link with specific query parameters to start issue creation and pre-fill fields. This is available without needing to integrate with Linear API.

The following links trigger the creation of a new Linear issue in any browser and you can add query parameters after any of them to pre-fill issue fields:

* http://linear.app/new
* http://linear.app/team/<team ID>/new
* http://linear.new

For example, you can assign new issues to a specific person, set an estimate, add labels, or combine multiple parameters with instructions in the description to create a template for a user to fill out.

## Generate a pre-filled link

You can open any issue page in Linear, open command menu using `Cmd/Ctrl + K` and then select _`Copy pre-filled create issue URL to clipboard`_. This will copy the URL to the clipboard, allowing you to quickly create a URL with parameters that will pre-fill the new issue creation state with the same properties set on the issue page.
