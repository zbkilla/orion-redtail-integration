## Overview 

The security and access page allows you to view and manage connected devices and applications.

## Sessions

See a list of current and previously connected devices from here along with details of the location, source type and date last seen.   
  
To revoke individual sessions, hover over them and choose the _Revoke access_ option. To remove all connections except the current one, choose _Revoke all._  
  
You can view additional details such as IP address or the original sign in date, by clicking on each entry.

## Personal API keys

Create or revoke API keys associated with your account.

## Authorized applications

View a list of your authorized OAuth applications here and the permissions they have been granted. You can remove their access by hovering over them and clicking on _Revoke access_.
