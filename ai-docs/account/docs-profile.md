# Profile

## Overview

Your profile found in [Settings > Account > Profile](https://linear.app/settings/account/profile) is where you personalize how other team members will see you in your Linear workspace.

## Set your profile picture

The default avatar will be the first and last initials of your account. To add a new photo, hover over the avatar until the edit pencil icon shows up, and click on it. A pop-up folder will show up for you to select the photo you want to update.

Once you've updated your avatar, you cannot remove itâ€”only replace it with another photo.

## Name and username

Members can set whether they see their team members' full names or usernames in their [Settings > Account > Preferences](https://linear.app/settings/account/preferences). You can adjust these to your preference of how you want others to refer you to.

## Email address

Your email address is your unique ID (User Account) for all workspaces you have created a User for. For example:

Action | Result
--- | ---
You joined Workspace A using jane.doe@email.com | A User Account was created under jane.doe@gmail.com and a User was created for Workspace A.
You joined Workspace B. | A User was created for Workspace B under your User Account jane.doe@email.com
You updated your email address in Workspace B to jdoe@gmail.com | Your email address for your User Account, Workspace A, and Workspace B was updated to jdoe@email.com. Jane.doe@email.com does not exist.

### Change your email address

To change your email address:

1. Go to [Settings > Account > Profile](https://linear.app/settings/account/profile).
2. Hover over your email address and click the pencil icon.
3. A pop-up box will appear for you to enter the new email address you want to switch to.
4. A confirmation email will be sent to both old and new email addresses. You need to click _both_ in order for the new email address to be confirmed.

Changing an email address will change the email address for **_all_** workspaces using the old email address. If you want to change the email address for just one workspace, we suggest inviting that email as a new user and leaving the workspace from the old email user.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization is changing domains and you'd like to change all emails in your workspace, please reach out to us at [support@linear.app](mailto:support@linear.app) from the existing domain and let us know the domain you would like to change to.

## Personal integrations

Personal integrations are software integrations in which each user has their own specific account. This helps Linear to associate your Linear user when an action taken in the third-party integration. You can see which of your account integrations are connected with Linear, as well as disconnect them.

## Leave your workspace

![Remove yourself from workspace](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/d42ac0acaf14b779330380ed6ab6e39ac31d5b8c-1404x280.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

To leave the workspace, click the **Leave workspace** option in Settings > Profile. Once removed, you no longer have access to the workspace. An admin will have to unsuspend your account in order for you to log back in.
