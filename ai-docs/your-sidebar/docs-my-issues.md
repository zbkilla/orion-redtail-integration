## Overview

My issues is a curated view that shows your most pertinent issues. It's split into four tabs: Issues assigned to you, created by you, to which you are subscribed, and issues with recent activity.

### Keyboard

`G` then `M` to go to _My Issues_

`Shift` `S` to subscribe to issues

`Cmd/Ctrl` `Shift` `S` to unsubscribe to issues

### Mouse

Find _My Issues_ in the top left sidebar under _Inbox_

Open an issue then click the three dots (more menu) at the top of the Activity to subscribe or unsubscribe to it

### Command menu

`my issues` to go to my issues

## Basics

### Curated priority order

By default, _My issues_ uses a unique grouping called _Focus_ that attempts to organize issues assigned to you in order of what you'd want to work on first. Issues are grouped in the following order:

* Urgent Issues
* Issues with SLAs
* Assigned issues blocking others
* Issues in your current cycle (optional)
* Issues in future cycles (optional)
* Other active _(e.g. issues in progress that do not fall into previous categories)_
* Triage (optional)
* Backlog issues
* Done
* Cancelled

Within each category, issues are ordered by priority, with started issues showing first.   
  
You can change the grouping options from the [display options](https://linear.app/docs/display-options) on the top-right of the view. 

### Created issues

My Issues is also where you'll find a list of all the issues you've created in the workspace, ordered by creation date. This includes issues you create via integrations with Slack, support tools such as Front, Intercom, and Zendesk, and Sentry.

### Subscribed issues

You're automatically subscribed to issues assigned to you, in which you've been @mentioned, and created by you. From subscribed issues (and most other places in the app), you can unsubscribe from issues individually or in bulk by selecting the issue(s) and then pressing `Shift` `S`. Do the same with `Cmd/Ctrl` `Shift` `S` to manage subscribers. Unsubscribe options show up in the command menu but not the contextual menu.

### Activity

The activity tab will show issues with the actions below that have occurred by date. 

* issue created
* issue updated
* assigned issue state changed
* issue commented
* comment reacted
* opened pull request
