Pulse keeps you informed about your workspace's project and initiative updates.

## Overview

Pulse is a feed of project and initiative updates in your workspace. It's available as a sidebar item when you want to read full updates as written, and as daily or weekly summaries delivered to your Inbox. 

## Basics

### Enable Pulse

Admins can turn on Pulse for their workspace in [Settings > Pulse](https://linear.app/settings/pulse), and set a default cadence for delivering summary notifications (Weekly on Mondays, every weekday, or never). If users customize their own schedule, they will override this default. Pulse is available on all Linear plans, but as a workspace-level concept it is not available to Guest roles.

### View Pulse

Read the full text of updates from the Pulse page in your sidebar. Optionally, customize your sidebar by right clicking on to change whether Pulse always appears, only appears when badged, or never appears.

Choose a specific Pulse tab to focus on the updates you want to see. The _For me_ tab includes projects you're a part of or may be interested in. _Popular_ gives priority to recent updates with emoji or comment engagement. _Recent_ displays every update organized by recency.

### Inbox notifications

Optionally, receive daily or weekly update summaries to your Inbox. Customize the cadence by right clicking on a Pulse inbox notification, through the Subscribe menu in Pulse, or in Preferences. Pulse updates arrive in your inbox by 7:00 AM in your local time.

These notifications contain updates for projects when

* You're a member of the project
* The project rolls up to an initiative you own
* You explicitly subscribed the project
* You're subscribed to all sub-projects for a project's initiative
* You're subscribed to all project updates from a particular team

You'll also receive Initiative updates to inbox when:

* You're the initiative's owner
* You're a member of the initiative's projects

### Custom feeds

Optionally, create personal feeds in Pulse based on custom filters. 

In busy workspaces with a high velocity of project and initiative updates, this can help narrow focus to a specific set of updates without needing to subscribe and unsubscribe to/from individual projects and initiatives. These feeds are only visible to you in the main Pulse page, and cannot be shared with others or subscribed to.

### Pulse audio
