# Inbox

The Inbox is your notification center in Linear and where you’ll find important updates on issues in your workspace.

## Overview

You'll receive an Inbox notification for key events on your subscribed issues. You are automatically subscribed to issues when you create them, are assigned them, or are mentioned in an issue description or comment.

You cannot customize which notifications go to the Inbox (they all will) but you can apply filters to focus on certain notification types.   
  
You can also customize which notifications trigger other alerts in [Settings > My Account > Notifications](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications).

## View notifications

Find your Inbox in the sidebar. The fastest way to get there is with the keyboard shortcut `G` then `I`, which takes you to the Inbox from any page.

Scroll through the notifications in your Inbox using `J` / `K` or `↑` / `↓` while on the list or individual notification view.

Click into the notification to view the individual issue in a special Inbox view, from which you can take Inbox actions as well as make changes to the issue.

## Inbox actions

From the list view you can take Inbox-related actions such as deleting or snoozing notifications as well as actions to update the issue properties.

`Right-click` over an issue to bring the contextual menu with available actions.

You can delete notifications with `Backspace`, delete all with `Shift` `Backspace`, or delete all read notifications by using `Cmd/Ctrl` `D`.

Select a notification and then use `U` to mark as read or unread, `Option/Alt U` to mark all issues as read or unread, and `H` to Snooze the issue (more below).

To unsubscribe from an issue via the Inbox view, you must click into it first and then unsubscribe use `Shift` `S`, the button in the top menu bar, or the unsubscribe option in the Activity feed.

## Quick search

Press `Cmd/Ctrl` `F` to bring up the quick search bar and then type to filter the list by title, issue ID, notification type, or assignee. It'll update the list to show only issues matching that search.  For example, see only notifications where someone commented on an issue or issues that have been auto-closed by Linear. `Esc` will clear the search.

## Display options

Open display options to update what properties are displayed on your notifications. You can toggle **Show snoozed** or **Show read** issues.

Because reminders do not hide an issue, there is no toggle in Display options regarding reminders.

## Snooze

Snoozing temporarily hides a notification from the Inbox or Triage. At the specified time, it will re-appear as a new notification and unread.

If new activity occurs before the Snooze time, you will receive an inbox notification for the activity and the Snooze will be canceled.

You can choose to show or hide snoozed notifications in your inbox display settings. 

## Issue Reminders

You can also set issue reminders for an issue, document, project or initiative and receive a notification to your Inbox at the selected time. 

Your scheduled reminder will show at the top of the issue and can be rescheduled or canceled as needed.
