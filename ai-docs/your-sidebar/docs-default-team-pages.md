Linear teams contain default views to organize issues and projects.

## Overview

Teams on your sidebar have the following pages: 

* [Triage](https://linear.app/docs/triage) (when enabled)
* Issues
* Cycles (when enabled)
  * Current
  * Upcoming
* Projects
* Views

Archived issues can be found under the `...`  menu when hovering over a Team name or by using the keyboard shortcut `g` followed by `x`.  
  
You can access views from the sidebar or with keyboard shortcuts.

`G` then `B` to go to backlog

`G` then `E` to go to all issues

`G` then `X` to go to archived issues

`G` then `C` to go to all cycles view

`G` then `V` for current cycle

`G` then `W` for upcoming cycle  
  
`Cmd/Ctrl` `B` to switch to board layout (or back to list)

### Mouse

### Command menu

`open team` or `Ctrl` `Shift` `1-9` to go to a different team, then access that team's views

## Issues

The Issues page shows all issues across the selected team that are _not archived or deleted._ This includes completed and canceled issues. There are default views within this page for Active issues and Backlog issues.

### Active

Active shows all active issues on your team, which are the issues under _Unstarted_ or _Started_ categories in your team's workflow. If you're using our default states, these would include _To Do_ and _In Progress_ but not _Backlog_, _Completed_, or _Canceled_ issues. Navigate to your team's active issues by hitting `G` then `A`.  


### Backlog

This includes issues in _backlog_, which is our default status for newly created unstarted issues. Navigate to your team's backlog issues by hitting `G` then `B`.

One backlog status exists by default but you can add more statuses in this group through team settings (e.g. Icebox). Any issues here will be updated to active (_To do)_ status if they're moved to a cycle. You can also enable a cycle setting to automate the reverse: if issues are moved out of a cycle, they'll move to the backlog. See cycles under team settings for more information.

### Archive

![Team archives](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/df7144571049827c598576a0a9d3afef7eac8af8-694x356.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Your team's archive page contains all archived issues, projects, and cycles for the team as well as recently deleted items. Archived items are kept for historical reference and can be restored anytime using the `#` shortcut. Issue links will still work even if the issue has been archived or is awaiting deletion but issues and projects must be unarchived in order to make changes to them. Deleted items are permanently removed 14 days after deletion.

Navigate to your team's archives page by clicking on the three dots next to your team's name in the sidebar and selecting **Open archives...** or use the keyboard shortcut `G` then `X`.

## Cycles

The Cycles page displays current, future, and past (unarchived) cycles and and shows some high level overview for you to compare between cycles. Click into any cycle here to view cycle issues and graphs. Past cycles will be archived according to the settings in auto-archive.

_Current_ cycle opens the current cycle and _Upcoming_ opens the next cycle.

## Projects

Projects shows all projects what are assigned to the team.

## Views

See existing custom views created for your team or workspace. You can also create new issue or project views from here.
