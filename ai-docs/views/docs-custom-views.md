# Custom Views

Create filtered views of issues or projects that you can save and share with others in your workspace.

## Overview

Create custom views using filters to show only the issues or projects you want to see. You can save, share and favorite these views for easy access and faster team collaboration.   


They're helpful if you often use the same filters, want to filter issues across multiple teams or projects, need to revisit or share a filtered list of projects or want to create shared views for easier team collaboration (e.g. bug reports).

## **Basics**

### Access views

Access views in the sidebar or type `G` then `U` from anywhere in the app to see a full list of Views across your workspace, teams, and any personal ones you've created. `O` then `V` will show a menu of available views that you can open.

### Create views

To build a custom view from scratch, click on Views in the sidebar, select _Issue views_ or _Project views_ as desired and click _New view_. Alternatively, click _Save_ after filtering a list of issues or projects.  

### Edit views

To edit an existing view, click on the view name from within the view itself and you can choose the _Edit view…_ option in the pop-up menu.   
  
You also have the option to duplicate an existing view from here, just click on the _Duplicate view..._ option.

### Create a view from a filtered list

You can save any filtered board or list as a custom view with the keyboard shortcut `Option/Alt` `V` or by clicking on the Save view icon. The icon appears next to the Display Options icon after you've add at least one filter to any team-specific list or board. When you create a custom view from a project or cycle-specific view, it'll automatically apply the project or cycle as a filter in the custom view. 

### Share views

![Share view](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/866f7257d57e24abaeb6ff6c8a613fc2f57eeca7-1998x850.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

If a shared view is created at the workspace level, then the view will be shared on the workspace level and appear under Workspace views on the Views page. If you select a specific team when creating the view, then only members of that team will see the shared view and it will be listed under Team views in the View page.   
  
To share a view across multiple teams but limit it to projects or issues within a specific team or teams, create an _All teams_ view and use filters to refine the list.

### Team Views

![+ Create new view button next to All Issues, Active and Backlog views](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/f8bbfb68fe973ab9e7de98fc8b8a7318653aff17-800x218.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

From your team's Issues and Projects sections, you can create new views to appear alongside the team's default views. These will be visible to all members of the team. Use the `+ Create new view` button beside the default or existing views to create additional views here. 

### Copy view link

To share a specific view in Slack or wherever you discuss work, copy a link by clicking the custom view's three dot (more) menu and selecting _Copy view URL_ or by copying the View's URL in the browser. Sharing a link does not automatically give anyone access to a view, it must be shared first.

### Favorite views

We recommend favoriting views that you access frequently, which will add the view under the Favorites section in your sidebar. Do this by clicking on the star next to the view name or from the more menu (three dots). Favoriting custom views also adds them as an option under default home view in [Settings > Account > Preferences](https://linear.app/settings/account/preferences).

### Collapse view group headers

Expand or collapse group headers when in list view by hovering over the group and pressing `t`, or clicking on the toggle icon at the left side of the group header.

### View sidebars

Use the righthand sidebar to understand the view's contents and quickly filter for common properties. Project view sidebars display information on those project's leads, teams, projects, initiatives and health. Issue view sidebars display assignees, labels and projects.

### View subscriptions

Configure personal or Slack channel notifications when an issue meets parameters defined by a view, or when an issue in a view is completed/canceled. 

#### Individual notifications

Click the bell icon at the top of an issue view. Select whether you'd like to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, marked completed or canceled, or both. 

To reduce notification noise, you won't receive notifications in views you subscribe to for actions you take yourself.

Once you've configured a view subscription, you can manage the subscription in [notification settings](https://linear.app/settings/account/notifications).

#### Slack channel notifications

Click the bell icon at the top of a view, then the _Configure_ button next to _Slack notifications_. Turn on the toggle and authorize Linear to post to a particular channel. Choose whether to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, completed/canceled, or both.

Moving forwards, notifications for these selected changes will be sent as messages to the chosen Slack channel.

### View owners

Every view has an owner property visible in that View's dedicated sidebar as well as on the main _Views_ page in Linear's main sidebar. This field defaults to the creator of the view but can be changed to other users as desired. Before deleting a view, we advise checking in with its owner to ensure it's no longer needed.

<summary>When should I use Initiatives instead of Project views?</summary>
If you want to curate a list of projects for planning purposes that map to an organization goal or objective and you want to keep track of overall progress, an initiative is the ideal tool. The projects in an initiative are manually curated and do not change over time unless new projects are manually added or removed.

In Project views, any projects meeting the view's filter criteria will appear. Use project views to represent the current state of work, or as a quick way to keep an eye on particular types of projects you care about.
