## Overview

Timeline views are a project planning tool that allows you to visualize and manage projects across time. It's specifically designed to only surface projects to keep project planning work cleanly separated from granular issue implementation.

## How to use Timeline view

### Product roadmap planning

* Use the timeline view for high-level project planning and roadmap visualization
* Use [milestones](https://linear.app/docs/project-dependencies) to mark important in-project checkpoints
* Set [project dependencies](https://linear.app/docs/project-dependencies) between related projects to maintain proper sequencing
* Set your view to week, month, quarter, or year to adjust your preferred level of detail.

### Launch planning

* Gain visibility into whatâ€™s shipping and when.
* Plan more effectively across product, engineering, and align on launch timings with GTM
* Click the **Show project updates** icon to get a consolidated feed of all the updates relating to the projects you're viewing in the timeline.
