## Overview

Peek is one of the semi-secrets of the Linear UI. It lets you view details of focused issues at a glance from any list or board view, similar to Quicklook in macOS.

### Keyboard

Tap `Space` to toggle peek on or off

`Space` and _hold_ to turn on peek only while `Space` is depressed

### Mouse

Peek can only be launched with the keyboard shortcut

### Command menu

Peek can only be launched with the keyboard shortcut

## Configure

Peek is a default setting in Linear available on many issue and project views. If peek is available for your page or view, you can launch it by pressing the `Space` bar and turn it off by pressing the `Space` bar again. To temporarily turn it on, hold the `Space` bar down. Peek will remain active until you let go of the `Space` bar. 

## Basics

Press `Space` to launch peek, then scroll through a list or board with (`J`/`K` or `↑`/`↓`) to launch the peek pop up. The peek preview will show information based on the items

* For issues, it will show a preview issue details including the description, assignee, status, priority, cycle, labels, estimate, creation date, and updated date.
* For projects, peek will show project details as well as the project graph.

## Quick look

When you have projects or issues in view in the `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `K` menu, get a preview without opening it by using quick look -- a variation on peek. When available, this is triggered by the right arrow key and adds a preview to the right side of the command menu.
