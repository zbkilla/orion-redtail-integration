### **Overview**

The Notion integration embeds Linear issues and projects into Notion pages. They can be previewed in Notion or clicked to open the file in Linear.



### **Configure**

Paste a link from Linear into Notion and follow the setup steps. Alternatively, Connect to Notion from within Linear under _[Settings > Features > Integrations > Notion](https://linear.app/settings/integrations/notion)._ Each user in a workspace wishing to use this integration must set it up individually. 

If desired, multiple Notion workspaces can be connected to the same Linear workspace.



### **Basics**

**Embed files**

Simply copy a link to a specific Linear issue or project and paste it into a Notion document. Choose whether to paste the link as a rich preview, a less detailed mention, or the raw URL.



**Open files**

Click the preview, mention or URL to open the associated data in Linear.  


**Refreshing mentions and previews**

Once issue, project, or view properties change in Linear, the preview in Notion changes accordingly (on page reload or manual preview refresh).
