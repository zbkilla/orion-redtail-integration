# Jira Terminology Translated

Are you looking for a handy resource to translate the terminology you are familiar using in Jira to the applicable features in Linear? Look no further! See the most common terms used in Jira below and the equivalent in Linear.

Jira | Linear
--- | ---
**Burndown Chart** | **Burn-up Chart**

Also known as cumulative flow diagrams, show how streams of work have changed over time. Unlike other insights, burn-up charts display your historical issue data so you can analyze and detect patterns across specific time windows. See documentation [here](https://linear.app/docs/insights#burn-up-charts).

**Cycle Graph**

Shows progress, effort and scope over time. See documentation [here](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles#sidebar-and-graph).

**Project Graph**

Shows you the progress you're making toward completing your project and estimates when you'll complete it.
**Epic**

The hierarchy for units of work in Jira Software is as follows: _Project > Epics/Components > Stories > Tasks > Subtasks_. | **Project**

We prefer fewer layers than Jira to ensure everything in Linear is clear and concise. The closest equivalent to Jira’s hierarchy in Linear is: _Team > Initiative > Projects > Milestones > Issues > Sub-issues_. See our documentation [here](https://linear.app/docs/projects).
**Kanban** | **Board Layout**

We don’t limit work in progress as this does not match our philosophy. We deliberately reduce roadblocks and friction to ensure every user is empowered to take the actions they need to take. See our documentation [here](https://linear.app/docs/board-layout).
**Project** | **Team**

While not a direct match in every use case, teams in Linear often do map to projects that existed in Jira. Take a look at the hierarchy listed under Epic/Milestone above for further context. See our documentation [here](https://linear.app/docs/teams).
**Scrum** | **Linear Method**

The methodology that we use in Linear**.** See our documentation [here](https://linear.app/method).
**Sprint** | **Cycle**

See our documentation [here](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles).
**Story** | **Issue**

We don’t have “stories” since we aim to reduce the complexity and number of layers. If you need to categorize different types of issues, you can use labels, label groups, parent issues, and custom views to achieve this.
**Swimlane** | **Rows**

The Board layout option in your Display Options support a secondary grouping.
