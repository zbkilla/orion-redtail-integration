**Why it matters:** Built by Linear and integrated with Slack, it streamlines your help desk workflows so that it’s easier than ever for anyone in your workspace (even without a seat in Linear) to submit, track, and manage requests.

## Insights: Data-informed decision making

**What it is:** Real-time analytics that transform your Linear data into actionable insights.

**Use them to:**

* Track resource allocation across Projects

## Triage responsibility: clear ownership roles

**What it is:** Define who handles incoming issues in your Triage inbox by automatically notifying or assigning specific team members.

**Why it matters:** No more issues falling through the cracks. Clear ownership means faster response times and better team accountability.

## Private Teams: Secure collaboration

**What it is:** Create teams with restricted access for sensitive work.
