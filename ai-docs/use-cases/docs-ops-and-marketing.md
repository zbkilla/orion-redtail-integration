## Basics

### Custom workflows

You can [customize workflows](https://linear.app/docs/configuring-workflows#custom-statuses) on every team to match the processes for your business area. The default Linear workflow follows a typical product flow of _Backlog > Todo > In Progress > Done > Canceled_ but you can modify workflow status names and add more.

For example, for sales, you might use _Lead > Contacted > In discussion > Onboarded > Closed-won > Churned_ while for content creation you might us_e Ideas > Todo > In Progress > Drafted > In Review > Ready to publish > Published > Canned._

### Views

Linear has powerful [filters](https://linear.app/docs/filters) that you can use and combine to build shareable [Views](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views). You can refine searches by various parameters including due date.

### Recurring issues

Use the in-built recurring issues feature in Linear to create issues automatically at a regular cadence. You can turn templates and existing issues into recurring issues from the [steps mentioned here](https://linear.app/docs/creating-issues#create-recurring-issues).   
  
Alternatively, you can use [Schedule by Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/schedule/integrations/linear) to create recurring issues in Linear. Follow the steps in Zapier or the video below to create a template for the recurring issue. It'll show up in your Linear issue list at the scheduled time.

### Create issues outside Linear

Hook up any form supported by Zapier to create issues whenever the form is filled out. This is great for collecting sales leads, customer follow up, user research, and reports from external stakeholders. If you do a lot of calls and need follow up issues for each one, you can set up an integration to create a Linear issue every time you add a new calendar entry.

### Support tooling

Use our existing integrations with Zendesk, Intercom, and Front to create issues for your team and easily get back to users when bugs are fixed and features launch.
