## Data regions

When creating a new workspace, you have the option to select the region where you want your data to be stored. The available options are:

* United States
* European Union

> [!NOTE]
> Your data region selection chosen at workspace creation is permanent, and cannot be updated at a later date.

Most of the data associated with the workspace — including issue descriptions and uploaded attachments—will only be stored in the selected region. Regardless of the region you select for your workspace, the following data is always stored in the United States:

* Information about the workspace, all user account information and user created API keys, used to authenticate users and direct them to the right region.
* Notification emails that are sent to workspace users will be stored in the U.S. for 7 days by our email sending partner.
* Usage data, used for analytical purposes.
* Workspace data and user account information used for analytical purposes. This data has been stripped of any information that might be confidential, including issue titles and descriptions, comment content, project names, team names, and document content and initiative names among others.
* User account information associated with any crashes that happen on the client or when processing a client or API request, in order to be able to debug crashes.
