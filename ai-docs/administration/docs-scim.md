# SCIM

SCIM, or _System for Cross-domain Identity Management_ allows for the automation of user provisioning for your Linear workspace. 

> [!NOTE]
> Available to workspaces on our [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plan

## Overview

With SCIM enabled, user accounts can be automatically created, updated, and suspended based on your IDP settings—eliminating the need for manual account management in Linear. This integration helps ensure that your team's access stays in sync with your organization’s directory.

## Configure

### Enable and test

1. Navigate to [Settings > Administration > Security](https://linear.app/settings/security)_._
2. Under the "Authentication" section, click **Configure** next to "SAML & SCIM".
3. Toggle the option to enable SCIM
4. Click _"View configuration"_ to get your **SCIM base connector URL** and **Bearer Auth token.** Keep these values at hand as you will need them to configure SCIM in your Identity provider.

> [!NOTE]
> Once enabled, Admins will **not** be able to manage users from within Linear as they will be kept up to date through your identity provider.  
> If necessary, you can temporarily enable a manual override to allow user suspension. This may be useful if you need to remove members or Guests that were added to Linear before you enabled SCIM.

#### OneLogin

* In OneLogin's Admin panel > Applications, click _Add App_
* Search for the "SCIM Provisioner with SAML (SCIM v2 Enterprise, full SAML)" app and add
* Click on the _Configuration_ tab and add your SCIM base URL and Bearer token
* Click on the _Provisioning_ tab and Enable Provisioning
* Save your App

#### Okta

* In the Okta admin pages, open the Linear application you have for SAML 2.0
* In the _General_ tab, click _Edit_ and choose _SCIM_ in the Provisioning section and _Save_
* In the _Provisioning_ tab, enter the SCIM Base connector URL you generated from Linear
* For the _Unique identifier_ field for users section enter **email**
* For _Supported provisioning actions_ you can enable "Import New Users and Profile Updates", "Push New Users" and "Push Profile Updates". Also select "Push Groups" if you are planning to sync selected Okta groups with Linear teams. "Import Groups" is optional, but can be selected to import existing Linear teams to be later linked to Okta groups.
* For _Authentication mode_ field, choose HTTP Header and enter your Bearer token generated from Linear. You can now test the configuration and save
* Lastly, return to the Provisioning tab in Okta and edit your settings under "To App" to enable the SCIM functionality needed for your Linear application (Create, Update and Deactivate users)

## Group push

Linear's SCIM integration also supports group push. From your side all you have to do is start pushing groups from your Identity provider to Linear. These will then map 1:1 with teams in Linear.

  
To link an existing team to a Group, you first need to import teams from Linear. These teams will be recognized as groups by your Identity provider. Once imported, you can then select the appropriate team when configuring group push.  


Once a team is linked to a Group, this team's membership is solely managed through your identity provider and not in Linear directly.

If you choose to disconnect the Push group from Linear in the future, you may see different options offered by your IDP:

* Opting to delete the group on Linear's side will remove all members from the Linear team and convert the team to private. Issues will remain unchanged.
* Disconnecting the group without sending a delete request will leave the team unchanged and not sync any changes to the team on Linear's side. From the team **Settings > Danger Zone** you can then unlink SCIM manually to resume managing the team as normal.

## Provisioning Roles

By default, all accounts created via SCIM via individual assignment or group push are provisioned as Members. You can also choose to provision specific users into Admin and Guest roles directly from your IDP.

To do this, you need to create `linear-admins` and `linear-guests` as push groups on the IDP side and sync their members with Linear. 

Once these have been connected to Linear, any users added to the group will be given the corresponding role in Linear. 

* These particular groups do not create Teams in Linear or sync membership with existing teams.
* You can rename these groups from your IDP after you've pushed them at first as `linear-admins` and `linear-guests`
*  You will not be able to assign or edit admin or guest roles manually when this link is in place..

## Disabling SCIM

Once SCIM is disabled on Linear side:

* SCIM requests coming from your Identity provider will be rejected on Linear side.
* Any team that was linked to a Group will be unlinked.
* All SCIM restrictions will stop being enforced.

This does mean that if SCIM is re-enabled on Linear side, any changes or member removals that happened on your Identity provider will have to be pushed again to Linear. Refer to your Identity provider documentation for more information on accomplishing this.

If you need to make changes to some accounts that are not part of your IDP, we recommend enabling the temporary override from your Linear SCIM settings, rather than disabling SCIM. You'll find the option for this at the bottom of your SCIM settings page.
