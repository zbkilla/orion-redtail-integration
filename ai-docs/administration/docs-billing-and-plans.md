## How our plans and billing works

### Plans

Refer to our [pricing page](https://linear.app/pricing) for the most up-to-date information on our plans offering.

### Billing

Customers are billed for the number of unsuspended users within a workspace. Thus, your paid plan only applies to the single workspace associated with it.

For billing frequency, we offer either monthly or yearly options.

#### Monthly billing

Your account is charged on a monthly basis for the number of unsuspended users in any role on your workspace.

Adding users mid-month will not result in a charge until the following month. Similarly, removing a user mid-month will not result in a credit for the remainder of the month.

#### Yearly billing

We charge your account for the whole subscription year based on the number of unsuspended users of any role you have at the time of purchase.

If you add or remove users to your workspace, we will bill or credit, respectively, a pro-rated amount for the remainder of the subscription year. 

Credits generated will be applied against future charges, and are not available as refunds.

At the end of the month, if there is a net balance owed, an invoice will be generated and either auto-charged or emailed based on your subscription settings.

## Manage your billing

Navigate to _[Settings > Workspace > Billing](https://linear.app/settings/billing)_ to access your plan information and make changes. From here, you can:

* View and change your plan.
* Update your payment information.
* Update the billing email.
* View billing history — past invoices and charges.
* We will also show if a charge is failed or past due.

### Change or Cancel a subscription

Workspace admins can change or cancel a subscription from [_Settings > Workspace > Plans_](https://linear.app/settings/plans). Subscription updates take effect at the _end of the subscription period_. If you are on a monthly plan, this will be at the end of the billing month. If you are on a yearly plan, this will be at the end of the billing year.

We do not provide refunds for cancellations mid-subscription. If you are uncertain you are ready to commit to a full year, we recommend starting on a monthly plan first. You can switch to yearly at a later date when you are ready to commit longer term and take advantage of the discounted rates.

When cancelling a subscription:

* Nothing will be deleted.
* If you have over 250 issues, you will no longer be able to create new issues.
* Members will become Admins of the workspace, as all users are Admins on free plans.

### Add a VAT number

To add a VAT number, choose the _I'm purchasing as a business_ option on the checkout page when upgrading.

To add a VAT number for an existing subscription, go to [Settings > Billing > Billing Details > Edit](https://linear.app/settings/billing). 

## Sales tax

In certain areas Linear is required to apply sales tax. The billing address you provide is used to determine whether tax must be applied, and if so the applicable rate.

Areas in which Linear must apply sales tax as of October 1st, 2023 include the following. We anticipate this list will grow over time, and we will keep it updated with new additions.

* Chicago, Illinois (PPLT Tax)
* Massachusetts
* New York
* Texas
* Utah
* Washington
* Pennsylvania
* District of Columbia
* Ohio

If needed, you can revise your billing address in _[Settings > Workspace > Billing](https://linear.app/settings/billing)._
