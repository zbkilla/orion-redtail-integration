## Notes

1. **Documentation Mapping**:
   - "Start Guide" → `docs-start-guide.md`
   - "Concepts" → `docs-conceptual-model.md` (covers Linear's conceptual model)
   - "Download Linear" → `docs-get-the-app.md`
   - "Preferences" → `docs-account-preferences.md`

2. **Security & Access**: This documentation appears in both Account and Administration sections, so it has been included in both folders for completeness.

3. **Additional Content**: The getting-started folder includes an extra guide for team members joining Linear, providing comprehensive onboarding documentation.
