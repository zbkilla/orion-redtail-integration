# Issues Documentation Status Report

## Overview
Review of Linear Issues section documentation coverage in the ai-docs/issues directory.

## Documentation Coverage Status

### ✅ Complete Coverage

All items from the Linear Issues menu are covered with corresponding documentation files, now organized in the `ai-docs/issues/` folder:

| Menu Item | Documentation File | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Create issues | `issues/docs-creating-issues.md` | ✅ Available |
| Edit issues | `issues/docs-editing-issues.md` | ✅ Available |
| Assign and delegate issues | `issues/docs-assigning-issues.md` | ✅ Available (includes delegation) |
| Select issues | `issues/docs-select-issues.md` | ✅ Available |
| Parent and Sub-Issues | `issues/docs-parent-and-sub-issues.md` | ✅ Available |
| Issue templates | `issues/docs-issue-templates.md` | ✅ Available |
| Comments and reactions | `issues/docs-comment-on-issues.md` | ✅ Available |
| Customer Requests | `issues/docs-customer-requests.md` | ✅ Available |
| Editor | `issues/docs-editor.md` | ✅ Available |
| Delete and archive issues | `issues/docs-delete-archive-issues.md` | ✅ Available |
| Issue relations | `issues/docs-issue-relations.md` | ✅ Available (additional)

## Notes

1. **Comments and reactions**: The documentation is stored as `docs-comment-on-issues.md` rather than a separate "comments-and-reactions" file. This file covers both commenting functionality and reactions.

2. **Assign and delegate**: Both assignment and delegation features are covered in a single file `docs-assigning-issues.md`, which is appropriate since delegation is a form of assignment used with agents.

3. **File Naming Convention**: All issue-related documentation follows the pattern `docs-[feature-name].md` for consistency.

## Documentation Quality Check

Sample verification of key files shows:
- Files contain comprehensive content with proper markdown formatting
- Include relevant images and videos (as links)
- Cover both basic usage and advanced features
- Include keyboard shortcuts and API references where applicable

## Recommendation

✅ **No action needed** - All Issues section documentation is present and accounted for in the ai-docs directory.
