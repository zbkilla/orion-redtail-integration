## Dependencies Management

### Critical Path Dependencies

Set up these project dependencies for proper timeline tracking:

#### Sequential Dependencies
```
Blocker Resolution → Phase 1 Start
Phase 1 Complete → Phase 2 Start
Phase 2 Complete → Phase 3 Start
Phase 3 Complete → Phase 4 Start
Phase 4 Complete → Phase 5 Start
Phase 5 Complete → Ongoing Maintenance
```

#### Parallel Dependencies
```
Test Environment Setup ←→ Data Cleanup
Documentation ←→ All Phases
Training Materials ←→ Phase 4-5
```

### How to Create Dependencies
1. In timeline view, hover at end of project bar
2. Click and drag to dependent project
3. Blue line = on track, Red line = violated
4. Use META key to maintain chain when moving

### Dependency Tracking Filters
